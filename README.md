# Transactions Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing **2010s transactions data** to extract insights on transaction patterns, user behavior, and fraud detection. The workflow combines **SQL for data loading and cleaning**, and **Python/Pandas** for further processing, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Raw data is stored in CSV and JSON files.  
   - SQL was used to load the data into a structured format and perform initial cleaning.

2. **Data Processing & Analysis in Python**  
   - After loading and cleaning the data, Python (Pandas) was used for further processing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis.  
   - Analysis includes aggregations, trend identification, user behavior analysis, and fraud detection.
